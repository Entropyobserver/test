1. Understand the Concept
Phonetic Clarity: Measured via word durations (in milliseconds). Longer durations indicate clearer articulation.
Surprisal: Quantified using a bigram model as 
ùëÜ
=
‚àí
log
‚Å°
2
(
ùëÉ
(
ùë§
)
)
S=‚àílog 
2
‚Äã
 (P(w)), where 
ùëÉ
(
ùë§
)
P(w) is the conditional probability of a word.
2. Prepare the Surprisal Data
Build a Bigram Model: Use wiki.train.raw to train a bigram model. Reuse code from Lab 2 if available.
Test Data: Select or construct 10+ sentences from wiki.test.raw (minimum 15 words each) where all bigrams exist in the dictionary.
Calculate Surprisal: For each sentence, compute surprisal values for all words and save the average surprisal per sentence.
3. Collect Speech Data
Record yourself reading the sentences from the test data.
Use a consistent format and naming convention (sentence1.wav, sentence2.wav, etc.).
Process these recordings through MAUS to get word-level durations.
4. Write the Scripts
get_durations.py:
Function get_lines() to read files.
Function get_durations() to parse MAUS outputs and extract word durations.
get_surprisals.py:
Functions to calculate unigrams, bigrams, probabilities, surprisal, and average surprisal for sentences.
get_linear_model.py:
Implement linear regression to model duration as a function of surprisal.
get_histogram.py:
Generate a histogram of word/sentence durations.
5. Data Validation
Unit Check: Ensure MAUS durations are in milliseconds (convert if needed).
Sanity Check: Cross-check durations with Praat or similar tools.
6. Perform Analysis
Compute the regression model using the data.csv file containing duration and surprisal columns.
Evaluate the model with metrics like p-value, 
ùëÖ

R 
2
 , intercept, and coefficient.
7. Visualizations
Create a histogram of durations.
Generate a scatter plot of durations vs. surprisal with a regression line.
