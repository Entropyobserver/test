    This is perhaps the most important part. So don't stop here!

    Firstly, and I cannot stress this enough, Python and R are different
    things! R is another programming language, and we will not use it
    in the course. It is mainly used for statistics. But everything you
    can do in R, you can also do in Python, basically. (There may be
    exceptions.) Let me amplify: Python and R are different!

    Why do I bring this up? Well, I am going to give you a link to a tutorial.
    The tutorial is on R. But by now, you should be able to follow it
    but use Python instead. If you prefer to read it first, that is fine.
    In fact, this is the most important part. Let me repeat that, too.
    The most important part is to read and understand! If you also manage to 
    do in Python what the tutorial is showing in R, it is great. But you
    have already used pandas and seaborn, so you have labbed a lot :D

    "Why a tutorial in R?" you might ask yourself. Well, because it is
    a GREAT tutorial. It explains all the basics you didn't know you wanted to
    know about linear models. It will greatly expand your path forward to a
    future as a researcher in academia or a data scientist in the industry.
