    Visit https://www.kaggle.com/ and have a look around. 
    Find a dataset in the .csv format that interests you. 
    It does not necessarily have to do with linguistics.

    Make sure the dataset is not more than a couple of MB large.

    Options if you cannot download without creating an account:

    If you are comfortable creating an account, download the dataset
    and save it in your home directory on Futurum.

    If you are not comfortable creating an account, specify your
    preferred dataset, and I will download it and place it in a
    temporary directory on futurum. 

    In this lab, you can connect with ThinLinc, which allows you
    to work remotely using a GUI. (Which allows you to work in
    Visual Studio Code.)

    If you prefer using the command line, that is fine, too.

    To connect with ThinLinc, open ThinLinc on a Windows computer
    in Chomsky or install it on your computer.
    
    Then follow the instructions here:
